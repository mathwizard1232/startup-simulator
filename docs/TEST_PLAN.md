# Startup Simulator - Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan outlines the strategy for implementing automated end-to-end tests for Startup Simulator. The primary goal is to ensure that existing functionality remains intact during refactoring and future development phases.

## Testing Objectives

1. Verify that the game can be played from start to win condition
2. Verify that the game can be played from start to lose condition
3. Ensure that all core game mechanics function as expected
4. Prevent regression of existing features during refactoring and new development

## Testing Approach

### End-to-End Testing

We will implement end-to-end tests that simulate a complete playthrough of the game, covering both win and lose scenarios. These tests will interact with the game through its web interface, simulating user actions and verifying expected outcomes.

### Test Framework

We will use Selenium with Python for our end-to-end tests. Selenium is a widely-used, standard tool for web application testing and integrates well with Python and Django.

### Test Environment

- Local development environment
- Clean database state before each test run
- Controlled random seed for reproducibility

## Test Scenarios

1. Complete Game Playthrough (Win Condition)
   - Start a new game
   - Make a series of predefined decisions
   - Verify that the win condition is reached

2. Complete Game Playthrough (Lose Condition)
   - Start a new game
   - Make a series of predefined decisions leading to failure
   - Verify that the lose condition is reached

3. Core Mechanics Verification
   - Employee hiring and management
   - Project creation and management
   - Financial management
   - Turn-based gameplay progression

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up Selenium with Python in the project
2. Implement a base test class for common setup and teardown operations
3. Create test cases for each scenario
4. Implement helper functions to interact with game elements
5. Add assertions to verify game state and outcomes

## Sample Test Structure
python
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
class StartupSimulatorTest(unittest.TestCase):
def setUp(self):
self.driver = webdriver.Chrome()
self.driver.get("http://localhost:8000") # Adjust URL as needed
def tearDown(self):
self.driver.quit()
def test_win_scenario(self):
# Implementation of win scenario test
def test_lose_scenario(self):
# Implementation of lose scenario test
def test_employee_hiring(self):
# Test employee hiring functionality
# Additional test methods for other core mechanics


## Continuous Integration

We will integrate these tests into our development workflow:

1. Run tests locally before committing changes
2. Set up a CI pipeline to run tests automatically on each push
3. Prevent merging of branches that fail the test suite

## Maintenance and Updates

- Update tests as new features are added
- Refactor tests as needed to maintain clarity and reliability
- Regularly review and update the test plan to ensure it remains relevant

By following this test plan, we aim to maintain the stability and reliability of Startup Simulator throughout its development process.
