# Phase 1.4: Implement Financial Management

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for financial management in Startup Simulator. The goal is to create a simplified but extensible accounting system, implement a basic VC funding mechanism, and provide players with financial insights and decision-making tools.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create Simplified Accounting System
   - Implement a single-entry bookkeeping system
   - Create categories for tracking expenses and revenue:
     - Expenses: Salaries, Marketing, Other
     - Revenue: Customer Payments
   - Develop a system to record financial transactions over time

2. Implement Basic Financial Reporting
   - Create a function to generate a basic income statement
   - Design a UI to display quarterly and annual financial results
   - Implement a simple cash flow tracking system

3. Develop VC Funding System
   - Implement two funding rounds: Seed and Series A
   - Create requirements for each funding round:
     - Seed: At least one paying customer, $50,000 annual revenue run rate, one paid employee
     - Series A: At least three paying customers, $250,000 annual revenue run rate, three paid employees
   - Design a UI for displaying funding round requirements and current company status

4. Create Funding Negotiation Interface
   - Implement a basic system for initiating funding rounds
   - Create a simple negotiation mechanic for determining funding amounts and terms
   - Design a UI for displaying negotiation results and accepting/rejecting offers

5. Implement Budget Allocation System
   - Create a system for allocating budget to marketing
   - Implement effects of marketing spend on customer acquisition
   - Design a UI for setting and adjusting marketing budget

6. Develop Employee Compensation System
   - Implement a system for managing employee salaries
   - Create a basic employee incentive plan mechanic
   - Design a UI for adjusting salaries and setting incentive plans

7. Implement Financial Decision Consequences
   - Create a system to track and apply the effects of financial decisions on company performance
   - Implement consequences for overspending or underfunding critical areas

8. Design Financial Management Interface
   - Create a dashboard for displaying key financial metrics
   - Implement a UI for accessing detailed financial reports
   - Design intuitive controls for making financial decisions

## Detailed Implementation Notes

### Accounting System
- Use a simple data structure to store financial transactions
- Implement functions to categorize and summarize transactions
- Create methods to calculate key financial metrics (e.g., revenue, expenses, profit/loss)

### VC Funding System
- Implement a check system to verify if company meets funding round requirements
- Create a randomized element in funding negotiations to add variability
- Design the system to be extensible for future funding rounds (Series B, C, etc.)

### Budget Allocation
- Implement a simple formula to calculate the impact of marketing spend on customer acquisition
- Create a system to track and apply budget allocations on a turn-by-turn basis

### Employee Compensation
- Implement a basic formula to calculate the impact of salaries and incentives on employee morale and productivity
- Create a system to track and apply salary changes and incentive payouts

## Testing Strategy
- Implement unit tests for core financial calculations and VC funding requirement checks
- Create integration tests to ensure proper interaction between financial systems and other game mechanics
- Conduct playtesting to balance financial decision impacts and ensure engaging gameplay

## UI/UX Considerations
- Design clear and intuitive visualizations for financial data
- Implement tooltips to explain financial terms and metrics
- Create a simple but informative interface for funding negotiations

By implementing these features, we'll create a basic but functional financial management system that adds depth to the gameplay while maintaining simplicity for the MVP. This system will serve as a foundation for more complex financial mechanics in future versions of the game.
