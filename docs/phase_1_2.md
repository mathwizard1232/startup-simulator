# Phase 1.2: Enhance Employee Management

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing employee management in Startup Simulator. The goal is to create a more realistic and engaging employee system with hidden skills, morale, productivity metrics, and basic personalities.

## Implementation Steps

1. Implement Name Generator
   - Create a system to generate unique employee names
   - Ensure names are entertaining and ideally reflective of the employee's personality

2. Create Skill Level System
   - Implement four skill attributes for each employee:
     - coding_speed
     - coding_accuracy
     - debugging
     - teamwork
   - Use a range of 1-10 for each skill
   - Implement a system to generate initial skill levels based on employee type:
     - Fast workers: Random skills, higher tendency for coding_speed
     - Perfectionists: Random skills, higher tendency for coding_accuracy

3. Implement Hidden Skill Attributes
   - Store actual skill values separately from perceived skill values
   - Create a system to update perceived skills based on employee performance and player interactions

4. Add Morale and Productivity Metrics
   - Implement a morale system (scale of 1-100)
   - Create a productivity calculation based on skill levels and morale

5. Implement Basic Personality System
   - Create a set of comedic personality traits (e.g., "jerk", "pushover", "coffee addict")
   - Assign one or two traits to each employee during generation
   - Implement effects of personality traits on team dynamics and individual performance

6. Update Employee Hiring Interface
   - Design a new hiring interface that allows for different hiring processes
   - Implement skill and personality revelation mechanics based on the chosen hiring process:
     - Resume only: No skill revelation, hint at personality
     - Phone interview: Partial revelation of teamwork skill and personality
     - Live coding test: Partial revelation of coding_speed and coding_accuracy
     - Full interview process: Partial revelation of all skills and personality

7. Implement Skill and Personality Revelation Mechanics
   - Create a system to gradually reveal and update perceived skills and personality traits through gameplay
   - Implement events that can trigger skill and personality perception updates (e.g., successful project completion, bug incidents, team conflicts)

8. Update Employee Management Interface
   - Design a new employee profile view showing name, type, visible attributes, personality traits, and current project
   - Create an interface for assigning employees to projects
   - Implement a basic employee list view with sorting and filtering options

9. Refactor Project Progress Calculation
   - Update project progress calculation to consider new skill attributes and personality traits
   - Implement Mythical Man Month principles in team productivity calculations
   - Factor in personality compatibility when calculating team performance

## Detailed Implementation Notes

### Personality System
- Create a list of comedic personality traits
- Implement a system to assign traits during employee generation
- Design functions to calculate the impact of personality traits on individual and team performance

### Skill and Personality Revelation System
- Store actual skill values (1-10) and personality traits internally
- Create a separate "perceived skill" system with qualitative labels (e.g., "poor", "good", "excellent")
- Implement a mapping system between numerical values and qualitative labels
- Create functions to update perceived skills and personality traits based on events and performance

### Productivity Calculation
- Base productivity on a combination of skill levels, morale, and personality traits
- Implement diminishing returns when multiple employees work on the same project
- Use the teamwork skill and personality compatibility to mitigate or exacerbate productivity changes in team settings

### Hiring Process
- Implement different hiring process options with varying costs and information revelation
- Create a system to generate slightly inaccurate skill estimations and personality hints during hiring

### Employee Performance Tracking
- Implement a system to track employee performance over time
- Create events that can trigger updates to perceived skills and personality traits (e.g., successful bug fixes, customer-reported issues, team conflicts)

## Testing Strategy
- Implement unit tests for skill, personality generation, and revelation functions
- Create integration tests for hiring processes and skill/personality updates
- Conduct playtesting to ensure the employee management system feels intuitive and engaging

## UI/UX Considerations
- Design the employee profile interface to clearly show perceived skills, personality traits, and their uncertainty
- Create intuitive visualizations for skill levels, morale, and personality traits
- Implement tooltips or help text to explain the hiring process options and their trade-offs

By implementing these enhancements, we'll create a more complex and realistic employee management system that adds depth to the gameplay while maintaining the game's focus on decision-making, strategy, and humor.
