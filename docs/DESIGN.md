# Startup Simulator - Design Document

## 1. Game Overview

### Concept
Startup Simulator is a business management simulator where players take on the role of a product manager, engineering manager, or other business leader responsible for managing software development in a start-up environment. Players make crucial decisions about hiring, firing, and managing software developers, as well as setting roadmap goals, interacting with customers and investors, and navigating the challenges of a fast-paced startup ecosystem.

### Target Audience
The game is primarily aimed at individuals who have experience working in a start-up environment. Similar to the comic strip Dilbert or the TV show Silicon Valley, Startup Simulator is a business comedy intended to express frustrations with actual work environments and address systematic issues in a wry, humorous manner. The target audience is likely to be somewhat cynical nerds who can appreciate the nuances and ironies of startup culture.

### Core Gameplay Loop
Inspired by games like "Yes, Your Grace," the core gameplay mechanism revolves around decision-making. Each day/week/turn, players are presented with various scenarios requiring their input:

1. A brief scenario is presented
2. The player makes a decision
3. Consequences unfold, both immediate and long-term

This loop creates a dynamic and engaging experience where players must constantly adapt to the evolving needs of their startup.

### Key Features

1. **"Fog of War" Elements**: The game incorporates uncertainty in various aspects, such as:
   - Unknown skill levels of programmers
   - Hidden bug counts in the codebase
   - Unpredictable market reactions

2. **Strategic Decision Making**: Players can choose overall directions and emphases but are realistically limited in their ability to micromanage every detail.

3. **Realistic Consequences**: The game allows players to micromanage but realistically punishes such behavior. For example:
   - Implementing an extensive interview process may provide detailed candidate information but drastically reduce the candidate pool
   - Requesting frequent status reports may increase visibility but lower team morale and productivity

4. **Dynamic Startup Environment**: Players must navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing startup ecosystem, balancing the needs of developers, customers, and investors.

5. **Humorous Scenarios**: The game presents various comedic situations that reflect real-world startup experiences, allowing players to laugh at familiar frustrations.

6. **Multiple Career Paths**: Players can experience the startup world from different perspectives, such as product manager, engineering manager, or other leadership roles.
