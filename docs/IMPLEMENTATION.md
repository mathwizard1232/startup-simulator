# Startup Simulator - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for Startup Simulator, a business management game focusing on software development in startup environments. The plan is divided into three main phases: Playable Demo, Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and Post-Launch Roadmap.

## Phase 1: Playable Demo (1 month)

### Goals
- Create a basic playable version of the game
- Implement core gameplay mechanics
- Establish the foundation for future development

### Features
1. Basic game loop
   - Start a new game
   - Make daily decisions
   - View results
   - End game conditions

2. Employee management
   - Hire employees (choice between perfectionist and fast worker)
   - Assign tasks

3. Project management
   - Create and manage software projects
   - Hidden bug generation
   - Basic feature development

4. Decision-making mechanics
   - Micromanagement options (e.g., frequency of status reports)
   - Resource allocation

5. Simple UI
   - Text-based interface with basic HTML/CSS
   - Minimal graphics

6. Two industries
   - Fintech
   - Game Development

### Technical Implementation
- Set up Django project structure
- Create basic data models (Employee, Project, Company)
- Implement core game logic in Python
- Create simple HTML templates for game interface

## Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) (1 month)

### Goals
- Refine and expand upon the playable demo
- Implement more detailed gameplay mechanics
- Improve user interface and experience

### Features
1. Enhanced employee management
   - More employee types and attributes
   - Skill development and training

2. Improved project management
   - More detailed bug and feature mechanics
   - Project milestones and deadlines

3. Financial management
   - Basic budget allocation
   - Revenue and expense tracking

4. Customer interaction
   - Customer satisfaction metrics
   - Basic market simulation

5. Industry-specific mechanics
   - Fintech: Regulatory fines for critical bugs
   - Game Development: More flexible quality vs. speed trade-offs

6. Improved UI
   - More polished HTML/CSS design
   - Basic JavaScript interactions
   - Simple data visualizations (e.g., charts for financial data)

7. Save/Load functionality

### Technical Implementation
- Expand data models (Customer, Market, Finance)
- Implement more complex game logic and algorithms
- Create more detailed HTML templates and CSS styles
- Add basic JavaScript for improved interactivity

## Phase 3: Post-Launch Roadmap

### Short-term Goals (1-3 months post-launch)
1. Bug fixes and performance improvements based on user feedback
2. Additional employee types and management options
3. More detailed financial management (investments, loans)
4. Expanded customer interaction (marketing, support)

### Medium-term Goals (3-6 months post-launch)
1. Additional industries (e.g., Biotech, Consumer Hardware)
2. More complex market simulation
3. Events and random occurrences
4. Basic achievement system

### Long-term Goals (6+ months post-launch)
1. Multiplayer features
2. Advanced UI with more interactive elements
3. Mobile-friendly version
4. User-generated content support
5. Educational partnerships

## Development Approach
- YOLO with AI
- Have fun!

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Python/Django
- Frontend: Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Database: 
  - Local version: SQLite
  - Hosted version: PostgreSQL (or similar)
- Deployment: 
  - Web-based application (primary focus)
  - Potential for standalone version in the future

## Notes
- Prioritize core gameplay mechanics over visual polish in early phases
- Maintain flexibility to adjust features based on playtesting feedback
- Aim for a balance between realism and engaging gameplay
- Incorporate educational elements naturally through gameplay, avoiding explicit tutorials
- Implement variable turn lengths (month, week, day) for different scenario complexities
- Ensure all decisions have some impact on code quality
- Implement randomness for "fog of war" effect in decision outcomes
- Consider accessibility in UI design (screen reader-friendly, avoid text in images)
- Plan for future internationalization/localization (not in demo or MVP scope)

## Future Considerations

### Implement MVC Architecture
- Consider refactoring the codebase to follow a more strict Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
- Move business logic from models and views into dedicated Controller classes.
- This refactoring can be done gradually during MVP development or as a separate phase after MVP completion.
- Benefits include:
  - Improved separation of concerns
  - More maintainable and testable code
  - Easier to scale and add new features

### Steps for MVC Implementation
1. Create a new `controllers` directory
2. Implement controller classes for each major component (e.g., EmployeeController, ProjectController, GameController)
3. Move business logic from views and models to appropriate controllers
4. Update views to use controllers for data manipulation and business logic
5. Keep models focused on data structure and database interactions
6. Refactor existing tests and add new ones for controllers

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing Startup Simulator, focusing on creating a playable demo within a month and an MVP within two months. The post-launch roadmap offers direction for future development while remaining flexible to user feedback and new ideas.
