# Phase 1.7: Implement Industry-Specific Mechanics

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for industry-specific mechanics in Startup Simulator. The goal is to create unique features and challenges for the Fintech and Game Development industries, enhancing the gameplay experience and realism.

## Implementation Steps

1. Fintech Industry Mechanics
   1.1 Regulatory Compliance System
   - Implement a basic regulatory compliance check function
   - Create a system to calculate customer impact based on existing bugs, number of customers, and chance
   - Design a warning/fine notification system for compliance issues

   1.2 Financial Product Development
   - Implement the following product types:
     - Credit Builder Card
     - Earned Wage Access
     - Cryptocurrency Account
     - Cryptocurrency Exchange (high complexity, high risk)
   - Create unique events for each product type (e.g., SFYL hacks for Cryptocurrency Exchange)

2. Game Development Industry Mechanics
   2.1 Game Genre and Platform Selection
   - Implement a selection of game genres (e.g., horror, sci-fi, RTS, turn-based, shooter)
   - Create fictionalized platforms as parodies of real platforms (e.g., "ZBox", "Joystation 9", "Thii")
   - Design a system for selecting genre and platform combinations

   2.2 Player Satisfaction and Review System
   - Implement an initial launch system that generates base sales and ratings
   - Create a feedback loop where prior sales and ratings influence new sales
   - Design a quality-based review generation system for ongoing player feedback

3. Industry-Specific Impact on Existing Systems
   3.1 Fintech-Specific Project Management
   - Enhance the bug impact system to reflect potential massive delayed impacts (regulatory fines, sanctions)
   - Adjust the value of perfectionist-type employees in fintech projects

   3.2 Game Development-Specific Project Management
   - Implement an "X-factor" system tied to team morale
   - Create a system where low morale teams cannot achieve the "X-factor" boost
   - Design a mechanic where high overtime can still produce profitable but initially buggy games

4. Industry-Specific Events
   - Integrate industry-specific events with the main event system
   - Implement Fintech events (e.g., regulatory audits, security breaches)
   - Implement Game Development events (e.g., viral marketing opportunities, game engine updates)

5. UI/UX for Industry-Specific Features
   - Design interfaces for selecting and managing industry-specific products/games
   - Create visualizations for regulatory compliance and player satisfaction
   - Implement industry-specific tooltips and help text

## Detailed Implementation Notes

### Regulatory Compliance System
- Create a function that runs periodically to check for compliance issues
- Use a weighted random system to determine the severity and frequency of compliance checks
- Implement a notification system for warnings and fines

### Game Launch and Review System
- Design a launch success calculation based on initial interest and game quality
- Implement a review generation system that considers game quality and player expectations
- Create a sales projection system based on reviews and prior sales

### X-factor System for Game Development
- Implement a hidden "creativity" score for each project
- Tie the creativity score to team morale and work conditions
- Create thresholds where high morale can lead to "breakout" hits

## Testing Strategy
- Implement unit tests for industry-specific calculations (e.g., compliance checks, review generation)
- Create integration tests to ensure proper interaction between industry mechanics and core game systems
- Conduct playtesting focused on industry-specific features to ensure balance and engagement

## UI/UX Considerations
- Design intuitive interfaces for managing industry-specific products and projects
- Create clear visualizations for regulatory compliance status and player satisfaction metrics
- Implement tooltips and help text to explain industry-specific concepts and mechanics

By implementing these industry-specific mechanics, we'll create a more diverse and engaging gameplay experience that reflects the unique challenges of the Fintech and Game Development industries while maintaining the game's focus on decision-making and strategy.
