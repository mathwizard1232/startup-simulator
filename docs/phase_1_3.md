# Phase 1.3: Improve Project Management

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for improving project management in Startup Simulator. The goal is to create a more realistic and engaging project management system that reflects the complexities and challenges of software development in startup environments.

## Implementation Steps

1. Refactor Project Creation Interface
   - Implement a flexible project creation system with customizable features
   - Create default project templates for quick setup
   - Allow for detailed customization of project complexity, features, and deadlines
   - Implement industry-specific project types (Fintech and Game Development)

2. Enhance Progress Calculation System
   - Implement a more complex progress calculation algorithm considering:
     - Employee skills (coding_speed, coding_accuracy, debugging, teamwork)
     - Employee morale and productivity
     - Project complexity and feature list
     - Allocated resources and time
     - Random events or setbacks
   - Incorporate Mythical Man Month principles in team productivity calculations

3. Implement Project Deadlines and Consequences
   - Create a system for setting and tracking project deadlines
   - Implement different types of deadlines (internal milestones, customer contracts)
   - Design consequences for missing deadlines:
     - Financial penalties for contract deadlines
     - Customer dissatisfaction for product launches
     - Industry-specific consequences (e.g., regulatory fines for Fintech, fan backlash for Game Development)

4. Enhance Feature Development System
   - Implement a more detailed feature development process
   - Create a system for estimating feature complexity and development time
   - Allow for feature prioritization and resource allocation

5. Refactor Bug Generation System
   - Base bug creation on code complexity, employee skills, and project conditions
   - Implement different bug types (minor, major, critical) with varying impacts
   - Create a system for bug discovery during development and testing phases
   - Implement bug fixing mechanics, including the possibility of introducing new bugs during fixes

6. Implement Testing Mechanics
   - Create different levels of testing (quick, standard, thorough)
   - Implement a system for allocating resources to testing
   - Design trade-offs between testing time, bug discovery, and project progress

7. Create Project Success Metrics
   - Implement a system for evaluating project success beyond just completion
   - Create metrics for code quality, customer satisfaction, and financial success
   - Design industry-specific success metrics (e.g., regulatory compliance for Fintech, player reviews for Game Development)

8. Implement Employee Morale and Incentive Systems
   - Create a system for profit-sharing or bonus agreements
   - Implement morale effects based on project success and reward distribution
   - Design "natural overtime" mechanics for motivated teams

9. Develop Industry-Specific Challenges
   - Implement regulatory compliance mechanics for Fintech projects
   - Create fan expectation and game quality mechanics for Game Development projects

10. Update User Interface for Project Management
    - Design an intuitive project overview dashboard
    - Create visualizations for project progress, deadlines, and resource allocation
    - Implement tooltips and help text to explain complex project management concepts

## Detailed Implementation Notes

### Progress Calculation Algorithm
- Implement a base progress rate determined by employee skills and project complexity
- Apply modifiers based on team size, considering diminishing returns for larger teams
- Incorporate random elements to simulate unexpected challenges or breakthroughs
- Factor in employee morale and productivity metrics

### Bug Generation and Management
- Implement a probability-based bug generation system influenced by code complexity, employee skills, and project conditions
- Create a system for classifying bugs by severity and impact
- Design mechanics for bug discovery during development, testing, and post-release phases
- Implement realistic bug fixing processes, including the possibility of introducing new bugs

### Deadline System
- Create a flexible deadline system that can handle both internal milestones and customer contracts
- Implement a notification system for approaching deadlines
- Design a system for deadline extensions with associated costs and consequences

### Industry-Specific Mechanics
- For Fintech:
  - Implement a regulatory compliance system with potential fines for critical bugs
  - Create mechanics for financial product testing and validation
- For Game Development:
  - Implement a fan expectation system that evolves based on announced features and release dates
  - Create a game quality evaluation system based on various factors (gameplay, graphics, story, etc.)

## Testing Strategy
- Implement unit tests for core project management functions (progress calculation, bug generation, deadline tracking)
- Create integration tests to ensure proper interaction between project management and other game systems
- Conduct extensive playtesting to balance project difficulty, progress rates, and bug frequency

## UI/UX Considerations
- Design an intuitive project creation interface that allows for both quick setup and detailed customization
- Create clear visualizations for project progress, deadlines, and resource allocation
- Implement tooltips and help text to explain complex project management concepts to players

By implementing these improvements, we'll create a more realistic and engaging project management system that reflects the challenges of software development in startup environments while maintaining the game's focus on decision-making and strategy.
