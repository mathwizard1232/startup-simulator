# Future Improvements for Startup Simulator

This document outlines improvements and changes to be considered for the MVP or future versions of Startup Simulator.

## Bug Generation System

Current implementation (demo version):
- Randomly generates bugs even when there's no code.
```python
def generate_hidden_bugs(self, project):
    num_bugs = random.randint(2, 5)
    for _ in range(num_bugs):
        Bug.objects.create(
            description=f"Hidden bug in {project.name}",
            project=project,
            state='UNDETECTED'
        )
```

See also `increase_bug_probability` (logic needs to be made more realistic/complex)

Improvement for MVP/future versions:
- Implement a more realistic bug generation system:
  - No bugs when there's no code
  - Bug probability increases as code complexity grows
  - Factor in employee skill levels and time constraints
  - Consider project difficulty when calculating bug probability
  - Implement different types of bugs (minor, major, critical)
  - Refactor bug generation system:
    - Generate bugs primarily when code is created or modified
    - Adjust bug probability based on current policies (e.g., overtime, status report frequency)
    - Remove or significantly reduce bug generation from policy changes alone
  - Improve bug naming and descriptions to be more realistic and informative
  - Implement a system for generating diverse and context-appropriate bug descriptions

## Project Management

Current implementation (demo version):
- Basic project creation with predefined features
- Simple "Update Project" functionality with random progress and bug detection

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Implement more detailed project management mechanics
- Allow custom feature creation and prioritization
- Introduce project deadlines and consequences for missing them
- Implement more realistic progress calculation based on employee skills and workload
- Add different project types with varying complexity and requirements
- Introduce project dependencies and resource conflicts

## Employee Management

Current implementation (demo version):
- Basic hiring of perfectionist or fast worker

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Expand employee attributes (e.g., experience, specializations, personality traits)
- Implement skill development and training systems
- Add employee satisfaction and productivity metrics
- Introduce team dynamics and synergy effects

## Project Management

Current implementation (demo version):
- Basic project creation and feature listing

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Implement project phases (planning, development, testing, deployment)
- Add project deadlines and milestones
- Introduce different project types with varying complexity
- Implement resource allocation system for assigning employees to projects

## Game Loop and Turn Structure

Current implementation (demo version):
- Simple turn increment

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Implement variable turn lengths (day, week, month) based on game complexity
- Add time-based events and deadlines
- Introduce more meaningful turn actions and consequences

## User Interface

Current implementation (demo version):
- Basic HTML templates

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Develop a more intuitive and visually appealing UI
- Implement responsive design for various devices
- Add data visualizations for company metrics and project progress
- Introduce accessibility features

## Industry-Specific Mechanics

Current implementation (demo version):
- Not implemented

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Implement unique mechanics for different industries (e.g., Fintech, Game Development)
- Add industry-specific events and challenges

## Financial Management

Current implementation (demo version):
- Basic company funds tracking

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Implement detailed financial tracking (revenue, expenses, profit/loss)
- Add investment rounds and funding mechanics
- Introduce market dynamics affecting company valuation

## Save/Load Functionality

Current implementation (demo version):
- Not implemented

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Implement save/load game functionality
- Consider cloud saves for the hosted version

This list will be updated and expanded as development progresses and new improvement areas are identified.
