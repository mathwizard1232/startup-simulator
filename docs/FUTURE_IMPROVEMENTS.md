# Future Improvements for Startup Simulator

This document outlines improvements and changes to be considered for the MVP or future versions of Startup Simulator.

## Bug Generation System

Current implementation (demo version):
- Randomly generates bugs even when there's no code.
```python
def generate_hidden_bugs(self, project):
    num_bugs = random.randint(2, 5)
    for _ in range(num_bugs):
        Bug.objects.create(
            description=f"Hidden bug in {project.name}",
            project=project,
            state='UNDETECTED'
        )
```

See also `increase_bug_probability` (logic needs to be made more realistic/complex)

Improvement for MVP/future versions:
- Implement a more realistic bug generation system:
  - No bugs when there's no code
  - Bug probability increases as code complexity grows
  - Factor in employee skill levels and time constraints
  - Consider project difficulty when calculating bug probability
  - Implement different types of bugs (minor, major, critical)
  - Refactor bug generation system:
    - Generate bugs primarily when code is created or modified
    - Adjust bug probability based on current policies (e.g., overtime, status report frequency)
    - Remove or significantly reduce bug generation from policy changes alone
  - Improve bug naming and descriptions to be more realistic and informative
  - Implement a system for generating diverse and context-appropriate bug descriptions

## Project Management

Current implementation (demo version):
- Basic project creation with predefined features
- Simple "Update Project" functionality with random progress and bug detection

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Implement more detailed project management mechanics
- Allow custom feature creation and prioritization
- Introduce project deadlines and consequences for missing them
- Implement more realistic progress calculation based on employee skills and workload
- Add different project types with varying complexity and requirements
- Introduce project dependencies and resource conflicts

## Employee Management

Current implementation (demo version):
- Basic hiring of perfectionist or fast worker
- Fixed skill levels for each type
- No employee names

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Implement a more realistic employee generation system:
  - Generate unique names for employees
  - Implement a range of skill levels for each employee type:
    - Fast workers: random skill from 1-5
    - Perfectionists: random skill from 3-7
  - Make skill a hidden attribute, only revealed through gameplay mechanics
- Expand employee attributes:
  - Experience
  - Specializations
  - Personality traits
  - More diverse employee types with various strengths and weaknesses
- Implement skill development and training systems
- Create a more complex salary calculation based on skills and experience
- Add employee satisfaction and productivity metrics
- Implement employee growth and skill improvement over time
- Introduce team dynamics and synergy effects:
  - Personality traits that affect team dynamics and project outcomes
  - Compatibility between team members
- Add employee management features:
  - Performance reviews
  - Promotions and demotions
  - Employee retention strategies
- Implement more realistic hiring processes:
  - Job postings
  - Resume screening
  - Interviews
  - Probation periods

## Project Management

Current implementation (demo version):
- Basic project creation and feature listing

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Implement project phases (planning, development, testing, deployment)
- Add project deadlines and milestones
- Introduce different project types with varying complexity
- Implement resource allocation system for assigning employees to projects

## Game Loop and Turn Structure

Current implementation (demo version):
- Simple turn increment

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Implement variable turn lengths (day, week, month) based on game complexity
- Add time-based events and deadlines
- Introduce more meaningful turn actions and consequences

## User Interface

Current implementation (demo version):
- Basic HTML templates

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Develop a more intuitive and visually appealing UI
- Implement responsive design for various devices
- Add data visualizations for company metrics and project progress
- Introduce accessibility features

## Industry-Specific Mechanics

Current implementation (demo version):
- Not implemented

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Implement unique mechanics for different industries (e.g., Fintech, Game Development)
- Add industry-specific events and challenges

## Financial Management

Current implementation (demo version):
- Basic company funds tracking

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Implement detailed financial tracking (revenue, expenses, profit/loss)
- Add investment rounds and funding mechanics
- Introduce market dynamics affecting company valuation

## Save/Load Functionality

Current implementation (demo version):
- Not implemented

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Implement save/load game functionality
- Consider cloud saves for the hosted version

This list will be updated and expanded as development progresses and new improvement areas are identified.

## End Game Conditions

Current implementation (demo version):
- Simple win condition: $1 million in cash
- Simple lose condition: $0 in cash
- Game ends upon reaching either condition

Improvements for MVP/future versions:
- Redefine "million-dollar company" based on company valuation, not cash
- Implement a more complex valuation system considering various factors:
  - Revenue
  - Growth rate
  - Industry-specific metrics
  - Market conditions
- Allow players to continue playing after reaching win conditions
- Implement multiple tiers of success (e.g., million-dollar, billion-dollar valuations)
- Create more nuanced lose conditions:
  - Implement financing options to prevent instant loss at $0 cash
  - Consider "losing control of the company" as a primary lose condition
  - Explore gameplay options after losing control (e.g., starting a new company, attempting to regain control)
- Add industry-specific win/lose conditions
- Implement long-term goals and achievements beyond initial success


## Testing notes (in-game testing)

"""
Notes for MVP/final version:
1. Testing should be optional:
   - Releasing untested code will save time but likely lose customers due to bugs.
   - Thorough testing improves code quality and customer satisfaction but is time-consuming and costly.
2. Implement different levels of testing:
   - Quick testing: Faster, less thorough, may miss some bugs.
   - Standard testing: Balanced approach.
   - Thorough testing: Time-consuming, catches most bugs, improves code quality.
3. Customer satisfaction should be affected by bug frequency and severity.
4. Time-to-market vs. code quality trade-off should be a key strategic decision for players.
5. Different employee types could have varying effectiveness in coding, testing, and bug fixing.
"""

## Refactor notes

We have a lot of very long files. We should refactor to break up these files.

We should opportunistically consider refactors at key steps, like after demo is done
and while planning for MVP, or after MVP and while planning for the next version
and so on.

We go fast when implementing a particular plan, and will be lazy on refactoring,
but will include refactoring before beginning any major new phase of development.

## Testing notes (our testing of Startup Simulator)

We've reached a state of complexity where we really do need automated tests
to avoid breaking existing functionality while making new changes.

These tests should be end-to-end tests, in addition to any unit tests we may
or may not add. We should have some testing that exercises the entire system.

I don't know what tooling would be best for this. We should look into that.

We are going to continue to do planning first, coding second, manual testing third,
and automated testing fourth, but we want to add automated testing to avoid
having to keep re-testing the entire system after every change or missing new bugs.

Above is the original version; below is the post-MVP version.

Keeping both for now as the above may still be useful in MVP planning and development.
