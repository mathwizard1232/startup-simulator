# Phase 1.5: Enhance Game Loop and Events

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the game loop and events system in Startup Simulator. The goal is to create a more engaging and dynamic gameplay experience that reflects the challenges and unpredictability of managing a startup.

## Implementation Steps

1. Refine Core Game Loop
   - Ensure the daily processing loop is robust and can handle player absence
   - Implement default actions for when the player is "not present"
   - Create a summary system for events that occurred during player absence

2. Implement Time-Based Event System
   - Design a flexible event system that can trigger based on various conditions (date, company state, etc.)
   - Create a queue for scheduled events
   - Implement a system for processing events during player absence

3. Create Industry-Specific Events
   - Develop two unique events for each industry (Fintech and Game Development)
   - Implement industry-specific consequences and decision options

4. Implement Random General Events
   - Create a pool of general events that can occur in any industry
   - Implement a system for triggering these events with appropriate frequency

5. Enhance Player Decision Consequences
   - Implement more nuanced effects for player decisions
   - Create a feedback system to inform players of the consequences of their actions
   - Design "hidden" effects that influence game state without immediate player notification

6. Implement Difficulty Scaling
   - Create easy, medium, and hard difficulty settings
   - Adjust event frequency and impact based on difficulty
   - Ensure only positive or neutral events occur on easy difficulty

7. Design "Petitioner" System
   - Create an interface for presenting daily "petitioners" or events to the player
   - Implement a system for managing multiple events per day
   - Design a method for players to prioritize or defer events

8. Enhance User Interface for Events
   - Design an intuitive interface for presenting events and decisions to the player
   - Create a system for displaying summaries of events that occurred during player absence
   - Implement tooltips or help text to explain the potential implications of decisions

## Detailed Implementation Notes

### Event System
- Create an Event class with properties such as type, description, options, and consequences
- Implement a system for scheduling events based on game time and conditions
- Design events to have both immediate and long-term consequences

### Industry-Specific Events
- Fintech events:
  1. Regulatory audit: Player must decide how to allocate resources to comply with new regulations
  2. Security breach: Player must manage the fallout and implement new security measures
- Game Development events:
  1. Viral marketing opportunity: Player decides whether to capitalize on a trending topic
  2. Game engine update: Player chooses whether to update the engine mid-development

### Difficulty Scaling
- Implement a difficulty modifier that affects event frequency and impact
- Adjust the probability of positive vs. negative events based on difficulty
- Scale other game aspects like progress rates and bug generation based on difficulty

### Player Feedback System
- Create a notification system for immediate consequences of player decisions
- Implement a "company mood" or similar metric to reflect the cumulative effect of player decisions
- Design periodic reports or reviews that highlight the long-term impacts of player choices

## Testing Strategy
- Implement unit tests for the event generation and processing systems
- Create integration tests to ensure proper interaction between the event system and other game mechanics
- Conduct extensive playtesting to balance event frequency and impact across different difficulty levels

## UI/UX Considerations
- Design an intuitive interface for presenting daily events and decisions
- Create clear visualizations for event outcomes and their impact on the company
- Implement a system for players to review past events and their consequences

By implementing these enhancements, we'll create a more dynamic and engaging game loop that challenges players with realistic startup scenarios while maintaining the game's focus on decision-making and strategy.
