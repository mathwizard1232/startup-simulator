# Refactor 0: Pre-MVP Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to refactor the existing Startup Simulator codebase before beginning work on the MVP. The goal is to improve code organization, reduce file sizes, and eliminate repetition.

## Steps

1. Create a base HTML template
   - Implement a base.html template with common elements
   - Update existing templates to extend the base template

2. Break up views.py
   - Separate views into logical groups (e.g., employee_views.py, project_views.py, game_views.py)
   - Update URL configurations to reflect the new structure

3. Refactor models
   - Review existing models for potential improvements
   - Consider creating separate files for each model (e.g., employee.py, project.py, company.py)

4. Implement utility functions
   - Create a utils.py file for common functions used across multiple views
   - Move repeated code into utility functions

5. Organize static files
   - Create separate directories for CSS, JavaScript, and images
   - Implement a consistent naming convention for static files

6. Refactor game logic
   - Review game.py (or equivalent) for potential improvements
   - Consider breaking down large functions into smaller, more focused functions

7. Implement Django forms
   - Create form classes for data input instead of handling form data directly in views

8. Review and update URL patterns
   - Ensure URL patterns are logically organized
   - Use URL naming for consistency

9. Implement Django class-based views where appropriate
   - Convert function-based views to class-based views where it improves code organization

10. Code cleanup
    - Remove any dead code or commented-out sections
    - Ensure consistent code formatting throughout the project

11. Update documentation
    - Review and update comments in the code
    - Update README.md with the new project structure

12. Run tests and fix any issues
    - Ensure all existing tests pass after refactoring
    - Update tests if necessary due to structural changes

Note: Throughout the refactoring process, run the test suite frequently to catch any regressions early.
