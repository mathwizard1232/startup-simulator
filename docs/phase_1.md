# Phase 1: MVP Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Startup Simulator. The plan builds upon the existing playable demo, refining and expanding features to create a more engaging and realistic gameplay experience.

## Implementation Steps

1. Refactor Turn Structure
   - Implement variable turn lengths (day, week, month)
   - Create a new turn selection interface
   - Update game loop to handle different turn lengths
   - Adjust time-based events and calculations based on turn length

2. Enhance Employee Management
   - Implement a name generator for unique employee names
   - Create a skill level system (range 1-10) for each employee type
   - Implement hidden skill attributes
   - Add basic morale and productivity metrics
   - Update employee hiring interface to reflect new attributes
   - Implement skill revelation mechanics through gameplay

3. Improve Project Management
   - Refactor progress calculation based on employee skills and workload
   - Implement project deadlines and consequences for missing them
   - Enhance feature development system
   - Refactor bug generation system:
     - Base bug creation on code complexity and employee skills
     - Implement different bug types (minor, major, critical)
     - Create bug discovery and fixing mechanics

4. Implement Financial Management
   - Create a more detailed financial tracking system (revenue, expenses, profit/loss)
   - Implement a VC funding system:
     - Create different funding stages (pre-seed, seed, Series A, B, C, etc.)
     - Implement minimum requirements for each funding stage
     - Design an interface for seeking and negotiating funding
   - Develop a basic budget allocation system

5. Enhance Game Loop and Events
   - Implement time-based events and deadlines
   - Create a system for random events specific to each industry
   - Develop more nuanced consequences for player decisions

6. Improve User Interface
   - Design and implement a more intuitive and visually appealing UI
   - Create responsive design for various devices
   - Implement basic data visualizations for company metrics and project progress
   - Add misleading but accurate productivity metrics (e.g., lines of code per week)

7. Implement Industry-Specific Mechanics
   - Develop unique features for Fintech industry:
     - Implement regulatory compliance mechanics
     - Create financial product development system
   - Develop unique features for Game Development industry:
     - Implement game genre and platform selection
     - Create player satisfaction and review system

8. Implement Save/Load Functionality
   - Design and implement save/load system with associated costs
   - Create "skill issue" accounting classification for save/load expenses
   - Implement difficulty-based variations in save/load costs

9. Refine End Game Conditions
   - Implement more nuanced win conditions based on company valuation
   - Create varied lose conditions beyond simple bankruptcy

10. Balance and Polish
    - Playtest and adjust game balance
    - Refine UI/UX based on playtesting feedback
    - Optimize performance
    - Fix any remaining bugs or issues

## Implementation Notes

- Prioritize core gameplay mechanics over visual polish
- Maintain flexibility to adjust features based on playtesting feedback
- Aim for a balance between realism and engaging gameplay
- Incorporate educational elements naturally through gameplay, avoiding explicit tutorials

## Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for new features and mechanics
- Conduct regular playtesting sessions to gather feedback
- Update and run end-to-end tests after implementing each major feature

## Timeline

Aim to complete the MVP implementation within 1-3 months, with a target of 1 month if possible. Adjust the timeline as needed based on development progress and available resources.
