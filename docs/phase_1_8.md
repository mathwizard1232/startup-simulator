# Phase 1.8: Implement Save/Load Functionality

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the save/load functionality in Startup Simulator. The goal is to create a system that allows players to save and load their game state while maintaining game balance and discouraging excessive use through associated costs.

## Implementation Steps

1. Implement State Serialization
   - Create a function to serialize all relevant game state into a saveable format
   - Implement a function to deserialize saved data and restore game state

2. Design Save/Load Interface
   - Create UI elements for manual save and load actions
   - Implement confirmation dialogs explaining the costs associated with save/load

3. Implement Save Functionality
   - Create a function to handle the save process
   - Apply save costs to both the current game state and the saved state
   - Store saved games on the server for hosted games

4. Implement Load Functionality
   - Create a function to handle the load process
   - Apply load costs to the loaded game state
   - Update the saved game on the server to reflect the new state after loading

5. Implement Difficulty-Based Cost System
   - Create a cost calculation function based on difficulty level:
     - Easy: Free saves and loads
     - Medium: Fixed costs (e.g., $5,000 for save, $10,000 for load)
     - Hard: Variable costs (fixed cost + percentage of annual revenue)
   - Implement checks to ensure the company can afford save/load actions

6. Create "Skill Issue" Accounting Classification
   - Implement a new expense category for save/load costs
   - Update financial tracking and reporting to include this new category

7. Implement Automatic Save/Resume
   - Create a system for automatically saving game state during gameplay
   - Implement functionality to resume from the latest auto-save when returning to the game

8. Implement Save Versioning
   - Add version information to save files
   - Create a system to handle loading saves from previous versions

9. Implement Save/Load Analytics
   - Track usage of manual save/load functionality
   - Implement analytics to monitor the impact on gameplay and balance

## Detailed Implementation Notes

### State Serialization
- Ensure all relevant game state is captured, including:
  - Company finances
  - Employee data
  - Project status
  - Game settings and difficulty
- Use a standardized format (e.g., JSON) for easy parsing and future-proofing

### Cost Calculation
- Implement the following cost structure:
  - Easy: No cost
  - Medium: Fixed cost (e.g., $5,000 for save, $10,000 for load)
  - Hard: Fixed cost + 5% of annual revenue for save, 10% for load
- Ensure costs are applied correctly to both current and saved game states

### Save Versioning
- Include a version number in each save file
- Implement a system to upgrade old save files to the current version when loading
- Create unit tests for loading saves from each previous version

### Server-Side Implementation
- For hosted games, implement server-side storage and retrieval of save files
- Ensure proper security measures to prevent unauthorized access to save files

## Testing Strategy
- Implement unit tests for serialization and deserialization functions
- Create integration tests for the entire save/load process
- Test save/load functionality across all difficulty levels
- Implement backwards compatibility tests for loading saves from previous versions
- Conduct playtesting to ensure save/load costs are balanced and effective

## UI/UX Considerations
- Design clear and intuitive UI elements for manual save and load actions
- Implement informative tooltips explaining the purpose and cost of manual saves
- Create confirmation dialogs that clearly state the cost of save/load actions
- Ensure the automatic save/resume feature is seamless and transparent to the user

By implementing this save/load system, we'll provide players with the flexibility to save and load their games while maintaining game balance through associated costs. The "skill issue" accounting classification adds a humorous element that discourages excessive use of the feature, preserving the intended gameplay experience.
