## Status

This game is currently at a "playable demo" state at the time of initial upload.

While it's possible to run and get to the win condition, the game is only technically
playable, not yet truly a demonstration of the concept in the sense of an enjoyable
and complex game.

So feel free to run it, but know that this is just a rough demonstration of the core concept.

Of more initial interest might be the design documents which covers a lot of the ideas
for future development.

I'm currently working on refactoring the code in preparation for the next phase of development. Feel
free to run latest or to check out the latest tag to see the demo in a working version if latest is broken. I've been bumping patch versions so far but when I complete the MVP I'll give it at least a minor version bump.
