## Status

This game is currently at a "playable demo" state at the time of initial upload.

While it's possible to run and get to the win condition, the game is only technically
playable, not yet truly a demonstration of the concept in the sense of an enjoyable
and complex game.

So feel free to run it, but know that this is just a rough demonstration of the core concept.

Of more initial interest might be the design documents which covers a lot of the ideas
for future development.

Up next will be planning for the "MVP" step (next phase which should polish it up enough to be worth showing off to see if there's any interest), adding testing to avoid regressions, refactoring existing code, and then following the then-created MVP implementation plan.
